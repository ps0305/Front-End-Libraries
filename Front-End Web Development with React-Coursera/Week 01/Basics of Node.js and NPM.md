#### Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise you will learn the basics of Node and NPM. At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:

* Set up package.json file in the project folder for configuring your Node and NPM for this project
* Install a NPM module and make use of it within your project.

#### Initializing package.json
* At the command prompt in your git-test folder, type
```js
npm init
```

* Follow along the prompts and answer the questions as follows: accept the default values for most of the entries, except set the entry point to index.html
* This should create a package.json file in your git-test folder.

Installing an NPM Module

* Install an NPM module, lite-server, that allows you to run a Node.js based development web server and serve up your project files. To do this, type the following at the prompt:
```js
npm install lite-server --save-dev
```

* You can check out more documentation on lite-server [here](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server).
* Next, open package.json in your editor and modify it as shown below. Note the addition of two lines, line 7 and line 9.

```js
{
  "name": "git-test",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is the Git and Node basic learning project",
  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "npm run lite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "lite": "lite-server"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://jogesh_k_muppala@bitbucket.org/jogesh_k_muppala/git-test.git"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "homepage": "https://bitbucket.org/jogesh_k_muppala/git-test#readme",
  "devDependencies": {
    "lite-server": "^2.2.2"
  }
}

```
* Next, start the development server by typing the following at the prompt:
```js
npm start
```

* This should open your index.html page in your default browser.
* If you now open the index.html page in an editor and make changes and save, the browser should immediately refresh to reflect the changes.
#### Setting up .gitignore
* Next, create a file in your project directory named .gitignore (Note: the name starts with a period)Then, add the following to the .gitignore file
**node_modules**

* Then do a git commit and push the changes to the online repository. You will note that the node_modules folder will not be added to the commit, and will not be uploaded to the repository.
